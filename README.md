# App Actions Visualizer

## Background
App Actions was [announced](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/) at Google I/O 2018 as a program for Android apps to integrate with Google and Assistant. With App Actions, Android apps can sign up for fulfilling user queries in the Assistant by including a short actions.xml configuration file in their APK. The [actions.xml](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/action-schema) file associates deep links in the app with semantic intents (AoG [built-in intents](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents)). Deep links can be provided either as a URL template with placeholders or as an “entity set reference”, a pointer for Google to discover relevant deep links in app-linked Web content or vertical-specific feeds.

## Project description
This project is to build an Android app that could help showcase the all the fulfillment options/deeplinks various Android apps provide to App Actions in an organized and detailed way.
